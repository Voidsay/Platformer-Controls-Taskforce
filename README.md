# Platformer-Controls-Taskforce
The Gool of the PCT is to create a completely free and adaptive script for Unity, that feels right.
Here lie the materials and scripts for development.

There isn't much here yet.

## Files and stuff
In BareMinimum you can find some Unity files that form the basis for the project.

To start with somethin I already prepared two shitty control/movement scripts (try them)
They are obviously unacceptable for a real game.

## The Problem
Let me phrase the problem:
**rigitbody movement is too ***floaty*** and **transform movement is too ***stiff*** (it has other limitations too, but let's ignore them for the sake of argument)

## Possible Solutions
In Unity there are many values to tweak and adjust. Here are some examples:
- use rigidbody controls and increase friction/drag
- use a different force mode (chage impulse to velocity...)
- create a more refined script
